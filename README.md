## WebController-Py

I quickly threw this together using [Onkyo-eiscp](https://github.com/miracle2k/onkyo-eiscp).

I created this so co-workers can control the volume of spotify while they take calls etc

## Todo
* Update the UI to be better.
* Take some variables into something like an .env file
* try to add spotify api so you can skip songs etc
